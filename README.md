## Athlete-Performance-Tracking-Dashboard
Built a Power BI dashboard for a fitness coach tracking 45 athletes, calculating 1RM progress, mobility scores, and training phase comparisons. Automated monthly reporting, saved 8 hours/week, and contributed to a 20% increase in client retention.
Overview

A fitness coach working with 45 athletes had no structured way to show measurable progress. Performance data was being recorded, but there was no clear reporting system to present results to clients.

The goal was simple:
Create a professional, easy-to-use dashboard that tracks athlete performance and helps the coach clearly demonstrate improvement.

The Problem

No formal reporting system.

Athlete progress was not visually tracked over time.

Difficult to show measurable improvement.

Hard to justify premium training packages.

Reporting manually would have taken ~8 hours per week.

The coach needed a structured and professional way to present results.

The Solution

I built a Power BI dashboard that tracks key performance metrics and generates monthly athlete reports.

The coach can select any athlete and instantly view:

1RM progress over time

Mobility score trends

Training phase comparisons

Overall performance improvements

Data is entered through SharePoint Lists and updates automatically in Power BI Service, allowing near real-time refresh.

The dashboard is fully branded, enabling the coach to share professional reports directly with athletes.

What I Did

Designed the dashboard layout for clarity and easy interpretation.

Created 17 DAX measures to calculate performance trends and training comparisons.

Built drill-through pages for detailed athlete-level analysis.

Set up automated refresh using SharePoint Lists + Power BI Service.

Worked closely with the coach to refine KPIs and improve calculations.

Results

Eliminated manual reporting (~8 hours saved per week).

Increased client retention by an estimated 20% in the first month.

Helped the coach justify premium packages by clearly showing measurable progress.

Improved client engagement through structured monthly performance reports.

Challenges

The most challenging parts were:

Designing a layout that was both professional and easy for non-technical clients to understand.

Building accurate DAX calculations for 1RM progression and training phase comparison.

Ensuring performance metrics were meaningful, not just visual.

Through iteration and collaboration with the coach, the dashboard evolved into a practical reporting system rather than just a visual tool.
